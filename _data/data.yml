    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I am a master's student in biomedical engineering at Universidad de los Andes in 
        Bogota, Colombia. My research interests have revolved about image acquisition and analysis.
        I have experience designing, building, and using custom optical microscopes. More recently,
        I have dedicated myself to deep learning based light field rendering and simultaneous volumetric imaging.

education:
    - degree: MSc in Biomedical Engineering
      university: Universidad de los Andes
      time: 2016 - present
      details: 
        My current thesis consists in developping automated deep-learning based light field rendering.

    - degree: BSc in Physics
      university: Universidad de los Andes
      time: 2011 - 2016
      details: |
        My bachelor's thesis consisted of the design and construction of a custom light field light
        sheet microscope; aimed at recording fast volumes in live samples.

          - Minor in Classical Studies (Latin)
          - Minor in Government

experiences:
    - role: Research intern
      time: 2018
      company: ICFO, Barcelona
      details: |
        I worked for the MesoBrain project on image acquisition of 3D neural cultures. Designed and
        built an inverted Single Plane Illumination microscope with an electrically tunable lens. 
        Also performed optical analysis of synthetic scaffolds for the cultures.


    - role: Research and Teaching Assistant
      time: 2016 - present
      company: Universidad de los Andes, Bogota
      details: |
        I have worked in research projects under the direction of Professor Pablo Arbelaez. I have taught Biostatistics
        at undergraduate level.
